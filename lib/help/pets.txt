===================================== Pets ====================================

     Through the magic of charm spells, as well as a few other ways, it's 
possible for an adventurer to have a pet monster join them to fight.  While at 
first glance, this seems great, but a seasoned adventurer will realize that 
this is both a blessing and a curse.  Obviously, having an extra attacker or 
even just a warm body to absorb some blows can be a nice boon.  However, one 
should expect to gain very little experience if they aren't landing a killing 
blow themselves.

Secondly, your pets can sometimes be so eager for battle that they can ignore 
you, potentially preventing you from reaching an enemy and blocking your shots.
If you try to just blow them up with the enemy, they can turn on you, giving 
you another monster to deal with.

Finally, it takes a good deal of concentration to maintain control over your 
pets.  The first few monster are free, but having several monsters or a few 
monsters that are much stronger than you can really hurt your mana regeneration
rate.  Keep this in mind if you get a pet that can summon more pets.

--- Obtaining a pet ---

You may obtain a pet through a number of ways.  Some spell realms allow ways 
for you to charm enemies you encounter or to summon monsters to aid you.

--- Commanding your pets ---

Your pets are magically trained to obey your commands.  You can order them to 
attack a monster, run to a specified position, stay close, or even leave your 
services.  You can issue commands to your pets through the pet command menu by 
pressing 'P'.
